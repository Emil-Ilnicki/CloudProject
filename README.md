# CloudProject
## How to run

1. Run `git pull https://github.com/Emil-Ilnicki/CloudProject.git` 

### Front End (Client Folder)

```bash
1. cd .\client
2. yarn install (If you dont have yarn run npm install --global yarn)
3. yarn start (MAKE SURE SERVER IS RUNNING FIRST)
```

When youre actually programming inside of the client folder what I like to do is open up VSCode by doing `code .` 
inside of the directory and opening up two terminals and split them. The terminal on the left is responsible for doing package installations
and the terminal on the right will keep the react server running (yarn start)

### Back End (Server)

```bash
1. cd .\server
2. yarn install (If you dont have yarn run npm install --global yarn)
3. nodemon
```
